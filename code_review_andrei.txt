Lexic.txt:
  - Adding comments or descriptions for each rule would greatly
  improve the readability of the grammar. This is especially
  important if this grammar definition is intended for use by
  others who may not be familiar with its purpose.

  - Specifiying all the letters wasn't necessary, could have used ...
  instead.

  - Ensure that the use of whitespace in your definitions accurately
  reflects how whitespace should be treated in the language. 
  Consider specifying how whitespace should be handled in the grammar.


Syntax.in.txt:
  - The <for-loop> and <while-loop> rules are defined with colons (:==)
  instead of double colons (::=). Make sure to use the correct
  notation consistently.
  
  - Some production rules are mentioned but not fully defined.
  For example, <assignment operator> is referenced but not defined
  in the provided grammar.


Token.in.txt:
  - The definition of <string literal> may need to consider escape
  sequences within strings, as this is common in many
  programming languages.

  - It's helpful to distinguish between terminal symbols (e.g., "true," "false," "=") 
  and non-terminal symbols (e.g., <integer literal>, <assignment operator>) for clarity.
